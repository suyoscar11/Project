When you have uncertainties in your data (some points are more trustworthy than others), you want points with small uncertainties to influence the fit more.

This is called a weighted least squares fit.

The formula:



𝑋
X is a vector: 

​
  (intercept and slope)

𝑌
Y is your column of 
𝑦
y data

𝐴
A is a matrix with columns: all ones (for intercept), and all x values

𝐶
C is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the variances (
​
 ) of each y value

What does this formula do?
Weights:
Multiplies everything by 
𝐶
−
1
C 
−1
  (the inverse of the uncertainties squared) so “good” data counts more.

Best Match:
Tries to find the combination of 
𝑚
m and 
𝑏
b that makes the predicted y-values as close as possible to your data y-values, with those weights.

How does the formula find the best-fit?
It minimizes the chi-squared:
